1.0.5 important note upgrade information
========================================

If you are upgrading from previous versions of note, you 
will need to create a new config file, since the format of
that file has completely changed!

Take a look at the sample in config/noterc for details.

note will NOT work with an existing database and an old config.
You have to create a new config based on your old settings.


Please don't forget to make a backup of your database before 
upgrading! I am not responsible for data loss!

READ THIS FILE, IF YOU ARE UPGRADING FROM 0.9 TO 1.0.x
======================================================


In any case: BACKUP your existing note database!!!!!!!
The format has not changed, but some default values
(see the new config file-sample). Use this command
to save your note database with your *old* version
of note:
	"note -D"
This works with both the mysql and the binary version.

You need to reedit your configfile. Please refer to the
sample config in config/noterc.

======================================================

This version of note has now encryption support build in.
If you decide to use it, you need to re-initialize your
note database. That's why, because your current database
is unencrypted and *if* you want to secure your data, you
need to secure everything. That means, your existing data
must be encrypted before you can use this new capability!

Follow this steps:
	o backup existing db:
	  $ note -D
	o backup the db:
	  $ cp .notedb .notedb.save
	  or (for mysql users!):
	  $ cp -r /usr/local/mysql/data/notedb ~/notedb.mysql.save
	o go into note and delete all existing notes:
	  $ note -d 1-20 (or however)
 	o now upgrade your note installation:
	  $ perl Makefile.PL; make install
	o re-configure note. Turn $USE_CRYPT on by setting it
	  to "YES".
	o re-initialize your database:
	  $ note -I note.dump.2323 (or whatever)
	  note will prompt you for a passphrase. It will be used
	  by Crypt::CBC for encrypting your data.
From now on, your data is encrypted. You will need the passphrase
you set above for decrypting it! So - don't forget it!

======================================================

AGAIN:	YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED! DO NOT UPGRADE WITHOUT MADE A 
	BACKUP OF YOUR DATABASE! I AM NOT RESPONSIBLE IF YOU
	LOOSE DATA!
