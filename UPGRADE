In any case: BACKUP your existing note database!!!!!!!
The format has not changed, but some default values
(see the new config file-sample). Use this command
to save your note database with your *old* version
of note:
	"note -D"
This works with both the mysql and the binary version.

You need to reedit your configfile, since there are now
some new required options! The most important: $dbdriver.

If you used previously a binary db without a config, then
you will get trouble with your existing notedb because the
default values for field sizes has been changed (it was too
small)! You have two choices: 
1. make a database dump ("note -D") with your old note-version.
2. remove your existing .notedb (and/or back it up!)
3. install the new note version
4. import the previously created dump ("note -I note.dump.23112")
or
Edit the config to reflect your field size settings. Set the
fields MAX_TIME=64 and MAX_NOTE=1024 (which was the default of
previous versions of note).


AGAIN:	YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED! DO NOT UPGRADE WITHOUT MADE A 
	BACKUP OF YOUR DATABASE! I AM NOT RESPONSIBLE IF YOU
	LOOSE DATA!
