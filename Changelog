0.5:
ADDED:		Topic support(requested). You can sort the various notes under
		different topics now.
FIXED:		There was another bug, which caused the list command to display
		the notes with a too high value of $maxlen.


0.4.2:
ADDED:		If run in interactive mode, note will at first do a list command.
FIXED:		A bug caused note to save bogus timestamps after editing a note.
CHANGED:	It does no more print 3 newlines before the menu in interactive mode.

		$ListType.



0.4.1:
ADDED:		The install.sh script for the mysql version is no able to install the
		required Mysql module directly from CPAN, thanks to David A. Bandel!
FIXED:		The mysql version did not display notes (i.e.: "note 3" did nothing)
CHANGED:	Again, the sql-format of the mysql database has been changed. Now
		there are only 3 fields, the number filed is the primary key, the id
		field in previous versions was a waste of diskspace...
CHANGED:	The format of the dump-output has been changed.
ADDED:		It is now possible to import previously dumped notes into the notedb
		(dumps from both versions are compatible with each other)
FIXED:		the function num_bereich() had a bug, which caused ot to ignore under
		some circumstances one number (i.e. "note -d 4-13" did nothing).


0.4:
CHANGED:	ok, mysql support is back again (upon requests). therefore there
		are two different version of the script in the same time with
		the same features, one for mysql and the other one for the binary
		database.
ADDED:		Dump to textfile capability. Later on I want to dump it into a 
		palm readable format, any help is welcome!
ADDED:		interactive mode.
CHANGED:	Better modularity, better code.
CHANGED:	note can now run without the need of a config file. If does not
		exist, it will try to work with default values.
ADDED:		sub num_bereich(), which allows one to specify more then one
		number for deletion or displaying (i.e.: "-d 1,4,7" or "-d 4-9")


0.3:
CHANGED:	it uses no more a mysql database, but a binary file instead.
		This is much faster!
ADDED:		note can display the notes with colors, it is turned off by default


0.2:
FIXED:		now any occurence of ' will be masked with \' before storage
		to the mysql database.
FIXED:		now numbers of notes will be recounted, if one delete one note,
		so the list of notes will everytime start with 1,2,3,...
CHANGED:	the look of the list output has been changed, similar to a table


0.1:
INITIAL RELEASE.
