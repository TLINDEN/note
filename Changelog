================================================================================

1.1.0:
CHANGED:	does no more use the external touch command to create a new
		file, use perls open() instead.
CHANGED:	excluded some of the help texts from the usage message and the
		interactive help command to a manpage.
ADDED:		new commandline flag "--encrypt" which one can use to encrypt
		the mysql database password. This will be decrypted before
		connecting to the db. There is also a new config file option
		"encrypt_passwd" which indicates an encrypted db-password.
ADDED:		another new config option "ShortCd", which can be set to "yes"
		or 1 and if set, then a command like "cd 13" would jump
		directly to the topic of the note with the number 13.
ADDED:		now you can at any time cd back to the "root" of the
		topic-structure using the command "cd /".
CHANGED:	mysql.pm does now only do a table-lock on single write
		accesses, no more on the whole session. This allows one to
		access the same db twice or more.
FIXED:		Changed README and Changelog for readability on 80 by 25
		displays. And changed indentation of the note script itself.
ADDED:		NOTEDB.pm - a generic module, which holds some methods, which
		are used by binary.pm, mysql.pm and dbm.pm.
ADDED:		NOTEDB.pm generate_search(), which allows one to
		use AND, OR and various combinations of them using ( and ).
ADDED:		a search does now return the 2nd line of a note if a matching
		note's first line is a topic.
CHANGED:	use "unshift" instead of push to add $libpath to @INC.
ADDED:		a new feature, Caching of notes. supported by binary.pm and
		mysql.pm. To turn it on, one need to set "Cache" in the config
		to a true value.

================================================================================

1.0.9:		jumped directly to 1.1.0, too many additions.

================================================================================

1.0.8:
FIXED:		typo in noterc shipped with package may caused confusion
		(BLOWFISH instead of Blowfish).
CHANGED:	changed the way note manages temporary filez. It uses now a
		random string instead of just it's own PID. It does also change
		it's umask to 077 and, if applicable (on ext2 filesystems)
		issues "chattr +s" which will cause the ext2 inodes to be
		zero'd after file deletion.
ADDED:		A new config option allows the user to specify her own
		temp-directory. The default is still /tmp.

================================================================================

1.0.7:
FIXED:		there was a bug in the search expression, use now \Q and \E.
ADDED:		--config <file> allows one to use another config than the
		default.

================================================================================

1.0.6:
FIXED:		there were some odd bugs in commandline parsing, some options
		were unavailable.
FIXED:		Forgot "PreferredEditor" config-option in the new config format.
FIXED:		the interactive "cd .." command has ignored the presence of a 
		"DefaultLong" setting(and search too)... thx to Peter.
CHANGED:	Optimized a little bit the output routine, now it is better to
		read.
ADDED:		sub format and appropriate config-option for text formatting
		capabilities.
CHANGED:	changed getconfig regexp, which allows now also to use 
		Option = Param.
FIXED:		was not possible to override config-options, which are set by
		default to something.
ADDED:		note checks now, if a database os actually really encrypted and
		exits with an error if it s and the user turned off encryption.
		This protects her from destroying it's own database ..

================================================================================

1.0.5:
FIXED:		the T (and t respectively) printed nothing out since 1.0.3!
		It does it now again...
ADDED:		a new database backend added, NOTEDB::dbm, which uses DBM
		files for storage.
FIXED:		&display-tree returns now, if there is no note, otherwise it
		would die because of an undefined refernce.
CHANGED:	Changed the config file format completely. It is now no more
		a perl file, instead it is a simple plain text file which note
		parses.
CHANGED:	Changed the way, note loads it database backend. It uses now
		the $dbdriver variable as module-name, which makes it possible
		easily to write your own backend without the need to change
		note itself.
FIXED:		Removed Getopt::Long option "bundling", causes errors with perl 
		5.6.0 and is not senceful.
FIXED:		Added the Getopt::Long option "no_ignore_case". In 1.0.4 options
		were case insensitive causing -i to be interpreted as --import
		instead of --interactive ;-(((
		
Thanks to Peter Palmreuter for the following fixed/additions:
ADDED:		a new config option $DEFAULT_LIST, which causes note,
		if turned to "LONG", to use long-listing as default.
		But it will still be able to use short-listing if you
		explicit specify that.
FIXED:		sub search prints now an appropriate error-message in
		case no searchstring was given instead of jumping to
		usage.
CHANGED:	Changed the text in the interactive help to reflect 
		changes of verion 1.0.3 (t and T).

================================================================================

1.0.4:
CHANGED:	Moved from @ARGV-parsing to Getopt::Long, adding options is now
		much easier and I do now understand my own code ;-)
ADDED:		--raw, the "Raw Mode", which turns off any formatting of output.

================================================================================

1.0.3:
ADDED:		"-" works also for --dump, but in the other direction. It causes
		note to dump to standard output instead into a file.
ADDED:		you can specify - as filename for use with --import and if you
		want to create a new note. "-" stands for standardinput and
		it allows you to pipe another commands output to note!
ADDED:		you can now use an environment variable for the passphrase
		(when using encryption). If it is present, note will not ask
		for a passphrase. This is very useful in comination with the
		addition above, for use in scripts.
CHANGED:	the interactive help screen is now coloured.
ADDED:		-o commandline switch, which causes note to overwrite an
		existing database when importing data from a previous dump.
		Very handy if you want to re-initialize your db, i.e. if you
		changed the format.
ADDED:		the long-tree-view (-T) displays now also the note-number of
		each note.

================================================================================

1.0.2:
ADDED:		Topic-Tree overview command (-t or -T).
ADDED:		Enhanced list command in interactive mode, you can now specify
		a topic which notes you want to see.
CHANGED:	updated the help and usage sections to reflect the additions
		above.

================================================================================

1.0.1:
FIXED:		fixed bug in NOTEDB::mysql, which caused note to store NULL
		values in db, if encryption was off. A really dump failure :-(

================================================================================

1.0.0:
CHANGED:	removed install.sh. use now a Makefile for installation.
ADDED:		Encryption support. Note can now encrypt notes using IDEA
		or DES as encryption-protocols(symetric).

================================================================================

0.9:
FIXED:		There were many new bugs after my last changes *grrrrr*. fixed.
		Works now properly, with both backends!
FIXED:		and another bug: recounting of numbers did not take care about
		the existing order! If you deleted note #12, then note #13
		became not neccessarily #12! Instead it becames any other
		number (kind of randomly...). 
CHANGED:	NOTEDB::binary set_del function changed, it does no more require
		a temporary file for number recount. Instead it uses get_all and
		stores all notes in RAM and then rewrites the database.
FIXED:		fixed the set_new call within note. It used 0 as the first param
		(number) which is not useful since we dont have support for
		autoincrement from all database backends.
FIXED:		fixed the function set_recountnum in NITEDB::mysql, it was also
		incorrect :-((( 0.8 seemed to be a very bad early alpha...
FIXED:		there was a bug in NOTEDB::binary which caused not to recount
		note numbers after deleting one :-(


================================================================================

0.8:
ADDED:		NOTEDB::binary. so now 0.8 is ready for shipping !
FIXED: 		regexp bug fixed. It was only possible to delete 2 items
		together
		separated by comma ("d 1,2,3,4" deleted only 1,2!).
ADDED:		Some new config options which reflects the new module structure.
		So you can change your database backend without the need to
		replace the note script itself.
FIXED:		the previously added feature "cd <topic>" didn't really work :-(
ADDED:		NOTEDB::mysql added. Perlmodule, which I will use within 
		note from now on instead of buildin functions for accessing the
		database. From now on I only need to maintain one version of
		note, since the module interface will be identical between the
		bin and sql version.
CHANGED:	The SQL code does not use Mysql.pm anymore. Instead it is coded
		using the more portable DBI module. This allows one easily to 
		switch to anther database, which is supported by DBI.
CHANGED:	Locking. The db-table will now be locked before note accesses
		it.
FIXED:		width of listings is now always the same independent of the
		stringlength of a certain note.


================================================================================

0.7:
ADDED:		one can now use the unix-like "cd" command to change to another 
		topic, thus use "cd topicname" instead just typing "topicname"!
FIXED:		there was a smal regex bug which maked it impossible to use
		such topics: "4 test", in such a case note just displayed note
		number 4 instead of cd'ing to topic "4 test".
ADDED:		a new config option "$KEEP_TIMESTAMP" allows a user to disable 
		note's default behavior of updating the timestamp of a note
		after editing it.



================================================================================


0.6:
FIXED:		oops - the new suptopic feature confused the commandline-mode of
		note! quickly corrected! so subtopics also available from
		commandline.
FIXED:		a small bug fiyed, it was impossible to use -D or -I from
		commandline, if $ALWAYS_INT was turned on, now it is.
FIXED:		fixed problem with local/global variable $time, which confused
		the script under certain circumstances, now $time is no more
		global, it will be read in (using &getdate) locally by &new
		and &edit.
CHANGED:	The Topic separator is no longer hardcoded, one can customize
		it using the $TopicSep variable, the default is now /, the
		backslash will no more work!
CHANGED:	use perl buildin localtime() function instead of
		GNU date, which is possibly not installed on every target
		system (i.e. win32), therefore better portability!
CHANGED:	use now the strict module
ADDED:		Support for subtopics added (and sub-sub-..-topics).
CHANGED:	Removed the "T" command, it is now obsolete.
CHANGED:	behavior of list command changed, now shows topics as well as
		notes under the current topic(if there are some).
CHANGED:	The ".." command takes you now one level higher in your topic-
		structure.
ADDED:		A new config option $PreferredEditor, which you can use to 
		specify your own choice of editor.		
FIXED:		A bug at line 769 causing single note where smaller than note-
		listings



================================================================================



0.5:
ADDED:		Topic support(requested). You can sort the various notes under
		different topics now.
FIXED:		There was another bug, which caused the list command to display
		the notes with a too high value of $maxlen.



================================================================================



0.4.2:
ADDED:		If run in interactive mode, note will at first do a list
		command.
FIXED:		A bug caused note to save bogus timestamps after editing a note.
CHANGED:	It does no more print 3 newlines before the menu in interactive
		mode.
FIXED:		Some more vars will be resetted during each loop in interactive
		mode. $ListType.



================================================================================



0.4.1:
ADDED:		The install.sh script for the mysql version is no able to 
		install the required Mysql module directly from CPAN, thanks
		to David A. Bandel!
FIXED:		The mysql version did not display notes (i.e.: "note 3" did
		nothing)
CHANGED:	Again, the sql-format of the mysql database has been changed.
		Now there are only 3 fields, the number filed is the primary
		key, the id field in previous versions was a waste of
		diskspace...
CHANGED:	The format of the dump-output has been changed.
ADDED:		It is now possible to import previously dumped notes into the
		notedb
		(dumps from both versions are compatible with each other)
FIXED:		the function num_bereich() had a bug, which caused ot to ignore under
		some circumstances one number (i.e. "note -d 4-13" did nothing).



================================================================================



0.4:
CHANGED:	ok, mysql support is back again (upon requests). therefore there
		are two different version of the script in the same time with
		the same features, one for mysql and the other one for the
		binary database.
ADDED:		Dump to textfile capability. Later on I want to dump it into a 
		palm readable format, any help is welcome!
ADDED:		interactive mode.
CHANGED:	Better modularity, better code.
CHANGED:	note can now run without the need of a config file. If does not
		exist, it will try to work with default values.
ADDED:		sub num_bereich(), which allows one to specify more then one
		number for deletion or displaying (i.e.: "-d 1,4,7" or "-d 4-9")



================================================================================



0.3:
CHANGED:	it uses no more a mysql database, but a binary file instead.
		This is much faster!
ADDED:		note can display the notes with colors, it is turned off by
		default


================================================================================


0.2:
FIXED:		now any occurence of ' will be masked with \' before storage
		to the mysql database.
FIXED:		now numbers of notes will be recounted, if one delete one note,
		so the list of notes will everytime start with 1,2,3,...
CHANGED:	the look of the list output has been changed, similar to a table


================================================================================

0.1:
INITIAL RELEASE.
