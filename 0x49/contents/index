<h3>welcome to the homepage of <I>note</I> by <a href="mailto: tom at daemon.de">Thomas Linden</a></h3>
<I>note</I> is a small console program written in perl, which allows 
you to manage notes similar to programs like "knotes" from 
commandline. Note can use different database-backends for 
notes-storage. It ships with a DBI-based mysql-module(which 
can also be used for other by DBI supported DBMS) and another 
module, which uses a binary file for storage and a DBM module.<br>
Note supports since version 1.0.0 encryption(IDEA or DES)!<p>
Here is a brief list of it's features:

<ul><li> Three different database backends, mysql(DBI), dbm, binary(bin file).
</li><li> Commandline interface using the standard perl module
          Getopt::Long, which allows you to use short or long
          command-line options.
</li><li> Interactive interface(pure ascii), the following functions
          are available in interactive mode: list, display, topic,
          delete, edit, help.
</li><li> Highly confiurable using a perlish configfile ~/.noterc.
          although it is configurable it is not required, note can
          run without a configfile using useful default presets.
</li><li> Colourized output is supported using ASCII Escape-Sequences.
</li><li> The user can customize the color for each item.
</li><li> Data can be stored in various different database backends,
          since all database access is excluded from the program itself
          in perl modules.
</li><li> Notes can be deleted, edited and you can search trough your notes.
</li><li> Notes can be categorized. Each category(topic) can contain multiple
          notes and even more sup-topics. There is no limitation about
          sub topics.
</li><li> You can view all notes in a list and it is possible only to view
          notes under a certain topic.
</li><li> There is a tree-view, which allows you to get an overview of your
          topic-hierarchy.
</li><li> Notes can be encrypted using DES or IDEA algorythms and Crypt::CBC.
</li><li> You can dump the contents of your note database into a plain text
          file, which can later be imported. Imports can be appended or it can
  </li><li>verwrite an existing database (-o).
</li><li> Note has scripting capabilities, you can create a new note by piping
          another commands output to note, you can also import a notedump from
          stdin as well es duming to stdout instead a file. Additional, there 
          is an option --raw available, which prints everything out completely
          without formatting.
</li><li> It can be installed without root-privileges.
</li><li> Last, a while ago a user stated: "... it simply does, what it says ..."
</li></ul>
