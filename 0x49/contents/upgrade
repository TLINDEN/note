                        <h2>upgrade from previous version of note to 1.0.x</h2>
<p>
In any case: BACKUP your existing note database!!!!!!!
The format has not changed, but some default values
(see the new config file-sample). Use this command
to save your note database with your *old* version
of note:<br>
        "note -D"<br>
This works with both the mysql and the binary version.
<p>
You need to reedit your configfile. Please refer to the
sample config in config/noterc.

This version of note has now encryption support build in.
If you decide to use it, you need to re-initialize your
note database. That's why, because your current database
is unencrypted and *if* you want to secure your data, you
need to secure everything. That means, your existing data
must be encrypted before you can use this new capability!
<p>
Follow this steps:
<ul>
        <li> backup existing db:
        <br>  $ note -D
        <li> backup the db:
        <br>  $ cp .notedb .notedb.save
          or (for mysql users!):
        <br>  $ cp -r /usr/local/mysql/data/notedb ~/notedb.mysql.save
        <li> go into note and delete all existing notes:
        <br>  $ note -d 1-20 (or however)
        <li> now upgrade your note installation:
        <br>  $ perl Makefile.PL; make install
        <li> re-configure note. Turn $USE_CRYPT on by setting it
          to "YES".
        <li> re-initialize your database:
        <br>  $ note -I note.dump.2323 (or whatever)<br>
          note will prompt you for a passphrase. It will be used
          by Crypt::CBC for encrypting your data.
</ul>
From now on, your data is encrypted. You will need the passphrase
you set above for decrypting it! So - don't forget it!
