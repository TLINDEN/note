                        <h2>changelog</h2>

<hr><ul>
1.0.8:
<li><b>FIXED</b>:<br>
	        typo in noterc shipped with package may caused confusion (BLOWFISH
                instead of Blowfish).
<li><b>CHANGED</b>:<br>
	        changed the way note manages temporary filez. It uses now a random
                string instead of just it's own PID. It does also change it's umask
                to 077 and, if applicable (on ext2 filesystems) issues "chattr +s"
                which will cause the ext2 inodes to be zero'd after file deletion.
<li><b>ADDED</b>:<br>          
		A new config option allows the user to specify her own temp-directory.
                The default is still /tmp.
</ul>

<hr><ul>
1.0.7:
<li><b>FIXED</b>:<br>          there was a bug in the search expression, use now \Q and \E.
<li><b>ADDED</b>:<br>          --config <file> allows one to use another config than the default.
</ul>
<hr><ul>
1.0.6:
<li><b>FIXED</b>:<br>          Forgot "PreferredEditor" config-option in the new config format.
<li><b>FIXED</b>:<br>          the interactive "cd .." command has ignored the presence of a 
                "DefaultLong" setting(and search too)... thx to Peter.
<li><b>CHANGED</b>:<br>        Optimized a little bit the output routine, now it is better to read.
<li><b>ADDED</b>:<br>          sub format and appropriate config-option for text formatting capabilities.
<li><b>CHANGED</b>:<br>        changed getconfig regexp, which allows now also to use Option = Param.
<li><b>FIXED</b>:<br>          was not possible to override config-options, which are set by default to
                something.
<li><b>ADDED</b>:<br>          note chacks now, if a database os actually really encrypted and exits with
                an error if it s and the user turned off encryption. This protects her from
                destroying it's own database ..

</ul><hr><ul>

1.0.5:
<li><b>FIXED</b>:<br>          the T (and t respectively) printed nothing out since 1.0.3! It does
                it now again...
<li><b>ADDED</b>:<br>          a new database backend added, NOTEDB::dbm, which uses DBM files for
                storage.
<li><b>FIXED</b>:<br>          &display-tree returns now, if there is no note, otherwise it
                would die because of an undefined refernce.
<li><b>CHANGED</b>:<br>        Changed the config file format completely. It is now no more a perl
                file, instead it is a simple plain text file which note parses.
<li><b>CHANGED</b>:<br>        Changed the way, note loads it database backend. It uses now the 
                $dbdriver variable as module-name, which makes it possible easily
                to write your own backend without the need to change note itself.
<li><b>FIXED</b>:<br>          Removed Getopt::Long option "bundling", causes errors with perl 
                5.6.0 and is not senceful.
<li><b>FIXED</b>:<br>          Added the Getopt::Long option "no_ignore_case". In 1.0.4 options
                were case insensitive causing -i to be interpreted as --import
                instead of --interactive ;-(((
<li><b>ADDED</b>:<br>          a new config option $DEFAULT_LIST, which causes note,  \
                if turned to "LONG", to use long-listing as default.    |
                But it will still be able to use short-listing if you   |
                explicit specify that.                                  |    submitted by
<li><b>FIXED</b>:<br>          sub search prints now an appropriate error-message in   |==> Peter Palmreuther
                case no searchstring was given instead of jumping to    |    thanks a lot!
                usage.                                                  |
<li><b>CHANGED</b>:<br>        Changed the text in the interactive help to reflect     |
                changes of verion 1.0.3 (t and T).                     /

</ul><hr><ul>

1.0.4:
<li><b>CHANGED</b>:<br>        Moved from @ARGV-parsing to Getopt::Long, adding options is now
                much easier and I do now understand my own code ;-)
<li><b>ADDED</b>:<br>          --raw, the "Raw Mode", which turns off any formatting of output.

</ul><hr><ul>

1.0.3:
<li><b>ADDED</b>:<br>          "-" works also for --dump, but in the other direction. It causes
                note to dump to standard output instead into a file.
<li><b>ADDED</b>:<br>          you can specify - as filename for use with --import and if you want
                to create a new note. "-" stands for standardinput and it allows you
                tp pipe another commands output to note!
<li><b>ADDED</b>:<br>          you can now use an environment variable for the passphrase (when using
                encryption). If it is presen, note will not ask for a passphrase. This
                is very usefull in comination with the addition above, for use in 
                scripts.
<li><b>CHANGED</b>:<br>        the interactive help screen is now coloured.
<li><b>ADDED</b>:<br>          -o commandline switch, which causes note to overwrite an existing
                database when importing data from a previous dump. Very handy if
                you want to re-initialize your db, i.e. if you changed the format.
<li><b>ADDED</b>:<br>          the long-tree-view (-T) displays now also the note-number of each
                note.

</ul><hr><ul>

1.0.2:
<li><b>ADDED</b>:<br>          Topic-Tree overview command (-t or -T).
<li><b>ADDED</b>:<br>          Enhanced list command in interactive mode, you can now specify
                a topic which notes you want to see.
<li><b>CHANGED</b>:<br>        updated the help and usage sections to reflect the additions above.

</ul><hr><ul>

1.0.1:
<li><b>FIXED</b>:<br>          fixed bug in NOTEDB::mysql, which caused note t store NULL values
                in db, if encryption was off. A really dump failure :-(

</ul><hr><ul>

1.0.0:
<li><b>CHANGED</b>:<br>        removed install.#!/bin/sh. use now a Makefile for installation.
<li><b>ADDED</b>:<br>          Encryption support. Note can now encrypt notes using IDEA
                or DES as encryption-protocols(symetric).

</ul><hr><ul>

0.9:
<li><b>FIXED</b>:<br>          There were many new bugs after my last changes *grrrrr*. fixed.
                Works now properly, with both backends!
<li><b>FIXED</b>:<br>          and another bug: recounting of numbers did not take care about
                the existing order! If you deleted note #12, then note #13 became
                not neccessarily #12! Instead it becames any other number (kind of
                randomly...). 
<li><b>CHANGED</b>:<br>        NOTEDB::binary set_del function changed, it does no more require
                a temporary file for number recount. Instead it uses get_all and
                stores all notes in RAM and then rewrites the database.
<li><b>FIXED</b>:<br>          fixed the set_new call within note. It used 0 as the first param
                (number) which is not useful since we dont have support for auto-
                increment from all database backends.
<li><b>FIXED</b>:<br>          fixed the function set_recountnum in NITEDB::mysql, it was also
                incorrect :-((( 0.8 seemed to be a very bad early alpha...........
<li><b>FIXED</b>:<br>          there was a bug in NOTEDB::binary which caused not to recount note
                numbers after deleting one :-(


</ul><hr><ul>

0.8:
<li><b>ADDED</b>:<br>          NOTEDB::binary. so now 0.8 is ready for shipping !
<li><b>FIXED</b>:<br>          regexp bug fixed. It was only possible to delete 2 items together
                separated by comma ("d 1,2,3,4" deleted only 1,2!).
<li><b>ADDED</b>:<br>          Some new config options which reflects the new module structure.
                So you can change your database backend without the need to
                replace the note script itself.
<li><b>FIXED</b>:<br>          the previously added feature "cd <topic>" didn't really work :-(
<li><b>ADDED</b>:<br>          NOTEDB::mysql added. Perlmodule, which I will use within 
                note from now on instead of buildin functions for accessing the
                database. From now on I only need to maintain one version of
                note, since the module interface will be identical between the
                bin and sql version.
<li><b>CHANGED</b>:<br>        The SQL code does not use Mysql.pm anymore. Instead it is coded
                using the more portable DBI module. This allows one easily to 
                switch to anther database, which is supported by DBI.
<li><b>CHANGED</b>:<br>        Locking. The db-table will now be locked before note accesses it.
<li><b>FIXED</b>:<br>          width of listings is now always the same independent of the string-
                length of a certain note.


</ul><hr><ul>

0.7:
<li><b>ADDED</b>:<br>          one can now use the unix-like "cd" command to change to another 
                topic, thus use "cd topicname" instead just typing "topicname"!
<li><b>FIXED</b>:<br>          there was a smal regex bug which maked it impossible to use such 
                topics: "4 test", in such a case note just displayed note number 4
                instead of cd'ing to topic "4 test".
<li><b>ADDED</b>:<br>          a new config option "$KEEP_TIMESTAMP" allows a user to disable 
                note's default behavior of updating the timestamp of a note after
                editing it.



</ul><hr><ul>


0.6:
<li><b>FIXED</b>:<br>          oops - the new suptopic feature confused the commandline-mode of
                note! quickly corrected! so subtopics also available from command-
                line.
<li><b>FIXED</b>:<br>          a small bug fiyed, it was impossible to use -D or -I from command-
                line, if $ALWAYS_INT was turned on, now it is.
<li><b>FIXED</b>:<br>          fixed problem with local/global variable $time, which confused
                the script under certain circumstances, now $time is no more global,
                it will be read in (using &getdate) locally by &new and &edit.
<li><b>CHANGED</b>:<br>        The Topic separator is no longer hardcoded, one can customize
                it using the $TopicSep variable, the default is now /, the backslash
                will no mor work!
<li><b>CHANGED</b>:<br>        use perl buildin localtime() function instead of
                GNU date, which is possibly not installed on every target
                system (i.e. win32), therefore better portability!
<li><b>CHANGED</b>:<br>        use now the strict module
<li><b>ADDED</b>:<br>          Support for subtopics added (and sub-sub-..-topics).
<li><b>CHANGED</b>:<br>        Removed the "T" command, it is now obsolete.
<li><b>CHANGED</b>:<br>        behavior of list command changed, now shows topics as well as
                notes under the current topic(if there are some).
<li><b>CHANGED</b>:<br>        The ".." command takes you now one level higher in your topic-
                structure.
<li><b>ADDED</b>:<br>          A new config option $PreferredEditor, which you can use to 
                specify your own choice of editor.              
<li><b>FIXED</b>:<br>          A bug at line 769 causing single note where smaller than note-
                listings



</ul><hr><ul>



0.5:
<li><b>ADDED</b>:<br>          Topic support(requested). You can sort the various notes under
                different topics now.
<li><b>FIXED</b>:<br>          There was another bug, which caused the list command to display
                the notes with a too high value of $maxlen.



</ul><hr><ul>



0.4.2:
<li><b>ADDED</b>:<br>          If run in interactive mode, note will at first do a list command.
<li><b>FIXED</b>:<br>          A bug caused note to save bogus timestamps after editing a note.
<li><b>CHANGED</b>:<br>        It does no more print 3 newlines before the menu in interactive mode.
<li><b>FIXED</b>:<br>          Some more vars will be resetted during each loop in interactive mode.
                $ListType.



</ul><hr><ul>



0.4.1:
<li><b>ADDED</b>:<br>          The install.#!/bin/sh script for the mysql version is no able to install the
                required Mysql module directly from CPAN, thanks to David A. Bandel!
<li><b>FIXED</b>:<br>          The mysql version did not display notes (i.e.: "note 3" did nothing)
<li><b>CHANGED</b>:<br>        Again, the sql-format of the mysql database has been changed. Now
                there are only 3 fields, the number filed is the primary key, the id
                field in previous versions was a waste of diskspace...
<li><b>CHANGED</b>:<br>        The format of the dump-output has been changed.
<li><b>ADDED</b>:<br>          It is now possible to import previously dumped notes into the notedb
                (dumps from both versions are compatible with each other)
<li><b>FIXED</b>:<br>          the function num_bereich() had a bug, which caused ot to ignore under
                some circumstances one number (i.e. "note -d 4-13" did nothing).



</ul><hr><ul>



0.4:
<li><b>CHANGED</b>:<br>        ok, mysql support is back again (upon requests). therefore there
                are two different version of the script in the same time with
                the same features, one for mysql and the other one for the binary
                database.
<li><b>ADDED</b>:<br>          Dump to textfile capability. Later on I want to dump it into a 
                palm readable format, any help is welcome!
<li><b>ADDED</b>:<br>          interactive mode.
<li><b>CHANGED</b>:<br>        Better modularity, better code.
<li><b>CHANGED</b>:<br>        note can now run without the need of a config file. If does not
                exist, it will try to work with default values.

<li><b>ADDED</b>:<br>          sub num_bereich(), which allows one to specify more then one
                number for deletion or displaying (i.e.: "-d 1,4,7" or "-d 4-9")



</ul><hr><ul>



0.3:
<li><b>CHANGED</b>:<br>        it uses no more a mysql database, but a binary file instead.
                This is much faster!
<li><b>ADDED</b>:<br>          note can display the notes with colors, it is turned off by default


</ul><hr><ul>


0.2:
<li><b>FIXED</b>:<br>          now any occurence of ' will be masked with \' before storage
                to the mysql database.
<li><b>FIXED</b>:<br>          now numbers of notes will be recounted, if one delete one note,
                so the list of notes will everytime start with 1,2,3,...
<li><b>CHANGED</b>:<br>        the look of the list output has been changed, similar to a table


</ul><hr>

0.1:
INITIAL RELEASE.
