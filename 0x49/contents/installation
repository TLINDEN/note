                        <h2>installation of note</h2>
<p>
        Unpack the tar-ball and issue the command:<br>
        $ perl Makefile.PL<br>
        It will ask you a few questions about file destinations.
        The script will find itself the proper destinations for
        the files. So, if you agree with it, simply press ENTER.
        However, you may decide to use other destinations. In this
        case, enter it, when asked. This maybe usefull, if you are
        installing it in your ome-directory and if you are not root! 
<p>
        For installation instructions for the mysql database installation
        see mysql/README.
<p>
        If want to use another SQL database, i.e. postgresql then set
        the option "DbDriver" to the name of the responding DBI-driver
        and create a symlink of this name like this:
<br>        /usr/lib/perl5/siteperl/NOTEDB $ ln -s mysql.pm oracle.pm
<br>        The functionality is the same, but not the name!
<p>
        The default binary file backend does not need any special installation
        procedure, you need only to spceify a filename in your config file.
<p>
        The DBM backend(NOTEDB::dbm) requires the existence of a directory,
        which you must specify in your config using the option "DbName".
<p>


<b>Configuration</b>

        This version of note doesn't neccessarily need
        a configuration file. But you can have one and change
        some default values. Take a look to the file config/noterc
        provided with this tarball. There are detailed instructions
        about every available parameter.
<br>        Simply copy this file into your home-directory and name it
        .noterc
        If you decide not to use the default database backend (a binary
        file), you will *need* a configuration!
