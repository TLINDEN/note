# 0.7
# This is a sample config for the note script
# You do not need it, if you keep the values
# here unchanged.
#
# Copy it to your $HOME as .noterc
# 
# IMPORTANT:
# If you previously used note 0.1 or 0.2 then
# you will already have such a file. This file
# is not compatible with the one for note 0.3 and higher!
# You have to delete it and to create a new one.
# 
# This config has to be valid perl code. Therefore
# please be carefull!
#
# You can contact me per email: <tom@daemon.de>
