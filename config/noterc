  # To turn on an option, set it to: 1, on or yes

  # you need to decide which database backend you want
  # to use. Please refer to the corresponding documentation
  # for closer information about the certain backend!
  # Currently supported types: "binary", "dbm", "mysql",
  # "general", "dumper", "pwsafe3" or "text".
  # You must also edit/uncomment one section below for the
  # backend you want to use!
dbdriver = binary



  #
  # BINARY backend (the default)
binary::dbname       = ~/.notedb     # filename
binary::MaxNoteByte  = 4096          # max bytes per note entry
binary::MaxTimeByte  = 64            # max bytes for the date



  #
  # MYSQL backend
mysql::dbhost          = localhost   # hostname
mysql::dbport          = 3306        # tcp port
mysql::dbuser          = you         # db login
mysql::dbpasswd        =             # db password
mysql::dbname          =             # database name (default: note)
mysql::encrypt_passwd  = 0           # mysql::dbpasswd is
                                     # encrypted (note --encrypt)


  #
  # DBM backend
dbm::directory = ~/.notedbm          # directory



  #
  # GENERAL backend
general::dbname = ~/.notedb          # filename


  #
  # TEXT backend
text::dbname = ~/.notedb             # filename


  #
  # DUMPER backend
dumper::dbname = ~/.notedb             # filename



  #
  # Password Safe v3 backend
  # Some notes on this one:
  # This backend maintains encryption itself, which is
  # mandatory as well. So you'll have to disable encryption
  # (UseEncryption = NO)!
  #
  # The Password Safe v3 file has its own fields for
  # password and username, which note doesn't have. To be
  # compatible, the pwsafe3 backend parses the note text
  # for those fields and stores them accordignly to the db:
  #
  # For username field: user|username|login|account|benutzer
  # For passwd field: password|pass|passwd|kennwort|pw
  #
  # If it doesn't find it, it will put empty strings
  # into the pwsafe3 database.
  #
  # The pwsafe3 database can be accessed by Password Safe
  # (see: http://passwordsafe.sourceforge.net/) or other
  # tools which support the format (see: 
  # http://passwordsafe.sourceforge.net/relatedprojects.shtml)
pwsafe3::dbname = ~/db.psafe3             # filename


  #
  # You can use encryption with note, that means notes and
  # timestamps will be stored encrypted. This is supported
  # by every db-backend.
UseEncryption = NO


  
  #
  # Specify the encryption protocol. The appropriate perl
  # module needs to be installed. Possible velues are
  # IDEA, DES or Blowfish, the default is IDEA.
CryptMethod  = IDEA


  
  #
  # You can run note always in interactive mode by simply
  # typing "note". The default is: YES.
AlwaysInteractive = YES



  #
  # In interactive mode, note issues a list command if you 
  # simply hit enter. By turning this on, it will issue a
  # longlist command instead if you hit just enter. 
  # The default is: NO
DefaultLong = NO



  #
  # You can use an external editor everytime from note instead
  # of STDIN for creating new notes. The default is: YES
AlwaysEditor = YES



  #
  # By default, note looks in the environment for a variable
  # $EDITOR or, if this is not the case, for $VISUAL and as
  # fallback it uses 'vi'.
  # You can override this by setting this variable here.
PreferredEditor = 



  #
  # If you don't prefer that note updates the timestamp of a
  # note after editing, turn this on. It will
  # keep the original timestamp if this option is set.
  # The default is: NO
KeepTimeStamp = NO



  #
  # You can specify your own topic separator here.
  # The default topic separator is a normal slash: "/"
TopicSeparator = /



  #
  # The maximum width for displaying a note, in CHARS.
  # Depends on your screen-size. You can set it to 
  # "auto", if you wish that note should determine the
  # available size automatically.
MaxLen = auto



  #
  # Turn this off if you dont want note to automatically
  # clear the screen after displaying something and after
  # exit. The default is: NO
AutoClear = NO



  #
  # note can use colors for output, turn this of, if
  # you don't like it, or if your terminal does
  # not support it. The default is: YES
UseColors = NO



  #
  # Color-definitions of the various items. Will only 
  # take effect, if "UseColors" is turned on!
  #
  # The following colors are available:
  # black, red, green, yellow, blue, magenta, cyan and white.  
  #
  # For bold color write it uppercase (BLACK will be bold black).
  # For underlined color append an underscore (blue_ will be underlined blue).
  # For inverted color append an "I" (greenI will be inverted green).
BorderColor		BLACK
NumberColor		blue
NoteColor		green
TimeColor		black
TopicColor		BLACK


  
  #
  # Additional to colors, you can also do a little bit of formatting your
  # notes (bold, underlined, italic) text. The default is: YES.
FormatText = NO



  #
  # You might specify your own directory for temporary files.
  # note needs to create some temp files during editing of notes.
  # You could protect this directory using the command: chmod 700 directory.
  # The default is: /tmp
TempDirectory = ~/tmp



  #
  # You can jump to a topic by typing "cd 13" in interactive mode.
  # The deault is: NO
ShortCd = YES



  #
  # note can use a cached copy of the note database for list/tree/search
  # this is currently only supported by the binary and the mysql backends,
  # the general and text backends have an internal cache.
  # The default is: NO
Cache = NO



  #
  # You can define your very own time format for time stamps
  # YY   - the last 2 digits of a year
  # YYYY - year
  # MM   - month
  # DD   - day
  # hh   - hours
  # mm   - minutes
  # ss   - seconds
  # This is the default: (18.10.2000 21:32:08)
TimeFormat = DD.MM.YYYY hh:mm:ss 



  #
  # You can make note readonly which is useful for database copies
  # The default is: NO
ReadOnly = NO



  #
  # Note may separate titles and topics using horizontal lines when
  # listing them. You can turn on this behavior by setting
  # PrintLines to YES.
  # The default is: NO
PrintLines = NO



  #
  # Add a hash to identify notes. Such a hash will persist several
  # importy/export cycles and makes each single note unique.
AddTicket = NO

  # That's all about it for now.
